# US Region Mobility Report Analysis Using Tableau

## Overview
This project analyzes mobility patterns and changes across different regions in the United States using the "2020_US_Region_Mobility_Report" dataset. The analysis is conducted using Tableau 📊, leveraging various visualizations to gain insights into trends, patterns, and correlations in mobility behavior.

## Objective
The objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project is to understand the impact of events, policies, and other factors on mobility behavior. By visualizing various mobility indicators over time and across regions, we aim to identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations within the dataset.

## Visualizations and Insights
1. **Line Chart - Trends Over Time ⏰**: Depicts changes in mobility indicators over time (date) for selected regions or the entire dataset. Each line represents a different mobility indicator. Insights include identifying overall trends and seasonal patterns in mobility changes.
2. **Bar Chart - Average Changes by Region 📊**: Displays the average percent change from baseline for each mobility indicator across different regions. Insights involve comparing mobility changes between regions to identify areas with significant deviations from the baseline.
3. **Heat Map - Weekday vs. Weekend Mobility 🗓️**: Features a heatmap where the x-axis represents weekdays and weekends, and the color signifies the percent change from baseline. Insights explore whether mobility patterns differ between weekdays and weekends.
4. **Geospatial Map - Mobility Changes by Region 🗺️**: Visualizes mobility changes on a map, with each region represented by a different color or size based on the percent change from baseline. Insights involve identifying geographic hotspots of mobility changes.
5. **Stacked Area Chart - Cumulative Changes Over Time 📈**: Demonstrates the cumulative sum of percent changes from baseline over time for different mobility indicators. Insights include analyzing the overall impact of mobility changes.
6. **Box Plot - Distribution of Mobility Changes 📊**: Presents the distribution of percent changes from baseline for each mobility indicator using box plots. Insights involve identifying outliers and variations in mobility changes.
7. **Correlation Matrix - Relationships Between Mobility Indicators ↔️**: Generates a correlation matrix to explore the relationships between different mobility indicators. Insights include determining significant correlations between mobility changes in different sectors.
